**Notes and Credits:**

Layer Zero is my submission for Week 0 of Harvard’s CS50 course, and my first completed game. It was inspired by cyberpunk fiction, classic hacker aesthetics, and shoot 'em up games.

Everything was designed, coded, and tested by me in Scratch.
Visuals are based on my concept art and were either created by me, generated with assistance from ChatGPT, or a combination of both.
